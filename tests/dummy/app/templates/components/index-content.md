## Confused?

Confused about how to write Ember Data tests or even what to test?

This addon contains a collection of test helpers to help you write better tests. It contains
3 modules: `serializer`, `adapter`, and `capture`.

The `serializer` and `adapter` modules contains helpers to help write serializer and adapter
unit tests. The third `capture` module contains helpers that captures certain side effects
to be inspected later.
